      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a concept confined to science fiction.
        Today, AI is embedded into our daily lives — from smart assistants like Siri and Alexa
        to advanced machine learning systems driving autonomous vehicles and powering healthcare diagnostics.

      <h2>The Evolution of AI</h2>
      <p>
        AI began with simple rule-based systems and has evolved into complex deep learning networks.
        Key milestones include the development of neural networks in the 1980s, IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess
        grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the emergence of GPT models, like ChatGPT, capable of human-like text generation.

      <h2>Ethical Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        With great power comes great responsibility. AI poses serious ethical concerns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bias in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes.</li>
        <li>Deepfakes and misinformation threaten digital trust.</li>
        <li>Job displacement due to automation is a growing concern.</li>
        <li>Lack of transparency in decision-making models (black-box problem).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
      <p>
        The future of AI holds both exciting possibilities and significant challenges.
        Innovations like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), explainable AI, and neuromorphic computing
        promise to push boundaries further. But ensuring AI aligns with human values will remain crucial.
